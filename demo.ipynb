He had been selling hot coffee and bagels on this corner for fifteen years, ever since his wife passed away, but tonight felt different—perhaps because the steady stream of commuters had thinned to just a few desperate souls seeking warmth. His small cart, tucked between the towering glass buildings, cast a faint glow through the misty darkness, and he watched as an elderly woman with a umbrella approached, her face illuminated by the yellow light. She purchased his last cup of coffee, and as she walked away, Marcus smiled, knowing that even in the rain, someone was still finding comfort in his simple offering.\n",
    "The city's endless rhythm continued around him, but for this moment, he felt like he was making a difference. The rain had been falling for hours now, turning the streets into rivers of gray water that reflected the neon signs of the nearby restaurants and stores. His cart, though modest, had become a familiar presence on this corner, a small oasis in the concrete jungle where people could pause, warm themselves, and perhaps find a moment of human connection in their hurried lives.\n",
    "As he wiped the condensation from his coffee cup, Marcus noticed a young man huddled under an overpass nearby, his jacket soaked through. The boy's eyes met Marcus's, and for a brief second, there was something in that look—hope, maybe desperation, or simply recognition of shared struggle. Marcus reached into his bag and pulled out another cup of coffee, offering it to the boy without hesitation. The young man accepted it with a quiet \"thank you,\" and Marcus felt that familiar warmth spreading through his chest, the kind that only comes from knowing you've made someone's night just a little bit better.\n",
    "The rain continued its relentless assault, but Marcus was no longer alone in the darkness. He had become more than just a vendor; he had become a small beacon of humanity in a city that often forgot to look up and notice the people who were trying to keep it all together, one cup of coffee at a time.\n",
